/**
 * Contract drift lint. The integrity guard (verify-package.js) checks file
 * COUNTS; this checks CONTRACT CONSISTENCY across ORC's by-design maintenance
 * drift: shared return/slice contracts are duplicated across many payload
 * files, and a partial edit ships a forked contract the orchestrator will
 * reject at runtime.
 *
 * Data-driven: each contract = a fixed-string token + the EXACT set of files
 * under templates/ expected to carry it. Fails loudly when a token is missing
 * from an expected file (a drift copy was skipped) OR appears in an unexpected
 * file (a new copy was added without registering it here).
 *
 * RULE: any commit that adds/removes a contract copy updates the table below
 * IN THE SAME COMMIT. Runs with `npm run verify` and on prepack.
